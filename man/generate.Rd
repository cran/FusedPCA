}
\description{
To generate an adjacency matrix of stochastic blockmodel, degree-corrected block model or cockroach graph model.
}
\usage{
gen.sbm(n, theta.in, theta.bw, K, seed)
gen.dcbm(n, theta.in, theta.bw, theta, K, seed)
gen.cr(n1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{n1}{
input integer -- one quarter of the number of nodes in the graph.
}
  \item{n}{
input integer -- the number of nodes in EACH community.
}
  \item{theta.in}{
input real number, which is the probability of a within community edge.
}
  \item{theta.bw}{
input real number, which is the probability of a between community edge.
}
  \item{theta}{
input vector, of dimension number of nodes in ALL communities, with each entry equal to the individual effect of each node.
}
  \item{K}{
input integer -- the number of communities.
}
  \item{seed}{
input integer -- the random seed you can set.
}
}
\value{
  an adjacency matrix.
